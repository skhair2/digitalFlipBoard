## FINAL GUIDANCE FOR YOUR TEAM

### Writing Best Practices

**✅ DO:**
- Use specific numbers (25-35% sales increase, not "more sales")
- Lead with benefits, not features
- Use power words (beautiful, instant, free, professional)
- Keep sentences short and scannable
- Always include a clear CTA
- Test different variations and measure
- Be authentic to the brand voice (whimsical but professional)

**❌ DON'T:**
- Make promises you can't back up
- Overcomplicate the value prop
- Use jargon without explanation
- Write for search engines only (humans first!)
- Ignore mobile readability
- Forget social proof / testimonials
- Use ALL CAPS (except for emphasis)

### A/B Testing Ideas

```
Test These:
1. "Beautiful Displays" vs. "Professional Signage"
2. "Free Forever" vs. "No Hidden Charges"
3. "Any Screen" vs. "Your TV or Monitor"
4. "Retro Charm" vs. "Nostalgic Aesthetic"
5. "Zero Hardware" vs. "Software Only"
```

### Tone of Voice

- **Primary Tone:** Confident but approachable
- **Secondary Tone:** Whimsical with professionalism
- **Avoid:** Corporate jargon, stuffy language, overly technical
- **Embrace:** Clear metaphors, personality, authenticity
